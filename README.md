# Bela adaptation of the Dynamic Stiff String Simulation


## Introduction
This is a Bela project for simulating a stiff string in real time.

This project uses C++14 features. You will need to add

    CPPFLAGS=-std=c++14

to the "Make Parameters" section in Bela IDE.

## Acknowledgements
The simulation is based on the Juce plugin by Silvin Willemsen [github.com/SilvinWillemsen/RealTimeDynamic](https://github.com/SilvinWillemsen/RealTimeDynamic) *[1]*.
